            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><em>An Ocean Apart</em> is a 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons adventure designed for 1st level characters. It can be run either as a oneshot, or an introduction to a larger campaign taking place in the Feywild.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                A fomorian slaver in disguise, known as the Wizard, was luring troubled people into his tower just off the coast from a remote fishing village. His promises of a new life in the Feywild were true in a sense, but none of those who sought him out imagined the grueling enslavement that followed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On her most recent journey back from the Feydark, the slaver’s keelboat was ambushed by goblin pirates. The Wizard is now himself a prisoner to goblins left behind by a larger fleet to plunder the hidden riches of Gullscry village.
            </p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The characters arrive in Gullscry just a couple of days after it’s been raided by goblin pirates. The adventure assumes the adventurers have already met.</p>
            <p>The adventure consists of the following parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="point">Part 1: Gullscry Village.</span> The characters investigate the village and find clues pointing them toward a nearby lighthouse. At night, goblin pirates arrive.</li>
                <li><span class="point">Part 2: Two Islands.</span> If the characters choose to investigate the lighthouse, they will uncover the Wizard’s operation, and possibly rescue some slaves in the process. Alternatively (or additionally), they may want to make sure the goblin pirates never attack Gullscry again, and take the fight to the pirates’ den.</li>
                <li><span class="point">Part 3: The Mournful Maiden.</span> The Wizard, in the guise of a plain villager, is held captive on board his own keelboat. They are anchored near the marauding goblins’ camp, and also atop a forgotten fey crossing, behind which rages an eldritch storm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Adventure Hook</h3>
            <p>The adventure, and the campaign it ties into, revolves around lost people and objects. Consider using one or more of the following hooks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="point">Missing friend.</span> The character is looking for a loved one who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Who were they? Why would they want to leave their former life behind? What personal item would they never part with?</li>
                <li><span class="point">Wanted criminal.</span> The character is a bounty hunter. Who are they after? What is the criminal’s sentence? Who else is after this bounty?</li>
                <li><span class="point">Prized possession.</span> The character is after a unique item. What significance does the item hold? How did it become lost? Who else might be after it?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you and your players have worked out what the characters are after, give them any number of the following clues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="point">The Wizard.</span> A person mentioned by the missing people. His name might appear in a rumor or letter, but there are no pictures or descriptions.</li>
                <li><span class="point">The Twilight Bridge.</span> The proposed meeting place. It is supposed to lead to a magical place untroubled by mortal concerns.</li>
                <li><span class="point">All Will Be Well.</span> A secret code-phrase. It is presented as a mantra against exhaustion and a ward against evil.</li>
            </ul>

                        <p>The main goal for this adventure as part of an ongoing campaign is to provide the characters with some information on the primary villain and an ongoing quest, rather than to resolve any hooks the adventurers start with.</p>
                        <p>Running this as a oneshot will require some tinkering, especially:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="point">Resolving adventure hooks.</span> Unless you plan on doing that later by your own devices, make sure to give every character an opportunity to resolve their hook.</li>
                            <li><span class="point">Exposing the real villain.</span> Unless you want to use the primary villain in a later adventure, make sure characters have an opportunity to expose him.</li>
                            <li><span class="point">Ending the adventure.</span> The final events force the adventurers into a completely new location; if you don’t want that, consider changing how they play out and conclude.</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2>Part 1: Gullscry Village</h2>
            <p>Clues of missing people or items have led the characters to Gullscry village. After journeying for two days from the nearest town through a landscape of barren hills, they arrive at a mist-shrouded shore, where a single intact building towers above still smoldering ruins.</p>
            <p>Hobgoblin pirates raided the village the previous day’s dawn. They killed or enslaved the younger villagers, leaving the elderly to their fate. Most of the pirates sailed north after the raid, but a small band of goblins remained behind, stationed on a small island just off the coast. They are digging up buried treasures around the beach and nearby hills.</p>
            <p>A dozen or so people are left in Gullscry now. All but one have given into despair and care little for their possessions, or even lives. Portray a mood of numb indifference, where haggard people wander aimlessly around the beach, huddle around the hearth at the inn, or seek solace at the shrine.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Thousands of years ago, an ancient dragon razed an elven city to the ground where Gullscry now stands. His fiery breath dessicated the earth for millenia to come, and his spirit still seeps in through the nearby fey crossing in the form of heavy mist.</p>
            <p>The people of Gullscry know nothing about the former settlement’s origin or fate. Their ancestors have stumbled upon a shore, where the sea often washed up items dropped into the water miles offshore. They took up fishing to hide a small, but profitable smuggling operation, and kept mostly to themselves for generations.</p>
            <p>Because of their isolation, most villagers look alike. What sets them apart are the various disfigurements their bodies have developed. Each villager has at least one such prominent feature, and their name usually reflects it. Villagers might be called Duckbill, Longarm, Threefingers, or Ulcer.</p>

                        <p>The villagers have a habit of being reticent towards outsiders. They will be helpful, as long as what they do gets the nosy adventurers out of the village.</p>
                        <p><span class="point">Pirates.</span> The pirate raid happened just the day before. Everyone who was at sea never came back. Goblins came in the evening to dig around the beach, and to test the tavern’s defenses.</p>
                        <p><span class="point">Twilight bridge.</span> On the rare clear dusk, you can see a shimmering bridge of light between the two small islands just offshore.</p>
                        <p><span class="point">The Wizard.</span> The Wizard is an old, blind man. He settled in the old tower on one of the tiny islands, and turned it into a lighthouse. People from far away that come to see him never come back. The light in the lighthouse has gone out recently, probably because of the goblins.</p>

            <p>The road to Gullscry runs along a mud-choked river. The water is clean enough to drink, but far from palatable. Observant characters (passive Perception 12 and higher) might notice shapes on the ground that might have been buildings in the distant past. A character that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recalls the story of a dragon attack on an elven city in this area some two thousand years ago.</p>

            <p>The local tavern is a sturdy structure of driftwood and stone. It stands on the foundation of a former elven garrison, and some of the ancient magic wards it to this day. It is run by Black Gills (LN human thug), a widow in her late thirties that looks twice her age. She is willing to let adventurers stay, even if it upsets the other villagers.</p>

                        <p><span class="point">Flaw.</span> Ever since she lost her family, Black openly blames everything bad that happens on the Maiden (see Area G4). The other villagers scorn her for that.</p>

            <p><span class="point">Inn stay.</span> The inn offers a poor accommodation in the attic for 2&nbsp;sp a night. After just a few hours there, the characters’ gear acquires a smell of fish that persists for a week.</p>
            <p><span class="point">Store.</span> Characters can purchase items with value up to 5&nbsp;sp. The items come in slightly twisted shapes and reek of fish.</p>
            <p><span class="point">Workshop.</span> If they wish, characters can borrow a set of carpenter’s tools, cook’s utensils, leatherworker’s tools, potter’s tools, weaver’s tools, or woodcarver’s tools for 1&nbsp;sp per day.</p>

            <p>The beach once had three large hovels that used to house up to a dozen people each. Now there are just piles of charred stone and driftwood.</p>
            <p><span class="point">Holes.</span> The ground is pocked with holes, where goblins were digging for treasure the night before. A character that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds pottery shards near the holes and deduces that clay jars or urns used to be buried in some of them.</p>
            <p><span class="point">Treasure.</span> The villagers refuse to speak about the urns’ contents, but adventurers may decide to uncover some themselves. It takes one character an hour’s work with a shovel to dig deep enough, and only 10% of holes dug at random spots will yield clay urns containing treasure. An average urn contains an equivalent of 3d6 gp in copper, silver and electrum pieces. It may also contain antiques or art objects worth up to 10 gp, or an item that used to belong to a person one of the adventurers is looking for.</p>

            <p>This statue’s features have eroded to near oblivion. It takes a lot of fantasy to imagine a mermaid holding her arms out to the sea. There are small tokens laid out in front of her: pretty seashells, pebbles and copper coins.</p>
            <p><span class="point">Maiden of the Depths.</span> A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check reveals that this is a statue of Siobhan, an archfey of the seas. If she’s active here, there must be a fey crossing nearby.</p>

            <h3>Event: Pirate Raid</h3>
            <p>At night, eight <a class="creature">goblin</a>s come to the village in two rowboats. They dig around the beach in search of buried treasure, or harass villagers barricaded inside the tavern. The goblins aren’t expecting a fight, so while each carries a scimitar, none of them have shortbows or shields (reducing their AC to 13).</p>
            <p>The constant mists in the area reduce visibility. Creatures and objects might be lightly or heavily obscured.</p>
            <p>If four or more goblins end up incapacitated or killed, the rest flees back to their island (detailed in Part 2).</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>After the characters explore the village and deal with the pirate raid, they face two major options: if they stay true to the original story hooks, they will want to investigate the Wizard’s lighthouse, situated on the aptly named Isle of Light. Adventurers who would rather deal with the immediate threat of goblin pirates will instead be more interested in the other island. Either way, they will have to cross about half a mile of sea.</p>
